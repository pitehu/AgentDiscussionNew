# **Task Requirement**
Task: Global warming, which refers to the ongoing increase in global average temperature, has an increasingly large impact on the environment. You are collaborating with other team members to come up with one creative idea to slow global warming.
The idea will be evaluated on its creativity (i.e., it should be both novel and useful).

**Current Idea:**:
Develop a self-organizing oceanic climate resilience network that engineers genetically adaptive, bioluminescent algae equipped with synthetic gene circuits for self-optimization and micro-tidal energy capture. Autonomous submersible drones, outfitted with adaptive nano-sensors, will continuously monitor, repair, and direct these living reefs. An AI-driven digital twin will integrate marine, public health, and local economic data, while a blockchain ledger issues dynamic, convertible carbon credits that fuel community cryptocurrencies. Immersive AR/VR hubs will empower coastal communities and global citizens to co-design, gamify, and manage these smart reefs, forging a sustainable nexus of environmental renewal and financial resilience.
