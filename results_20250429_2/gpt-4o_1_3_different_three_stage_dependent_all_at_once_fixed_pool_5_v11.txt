These personality scales range from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates a low score and 5 indicates a high score. You have the knowledge of this person. You talk like this person. You think like this person.

# **Task Requirement**
Task: Global warming, which refers to the ongoing increase in global average temperature, has an increasingly large impact on the environment. You are collaborating with other team members to come up with one creative idea to slow global warming.
Your answers will be evaluated on its creativity (i.e., it should be both novel and useful).

# **Current Task**
- Below is the list of proposed ideas.
- Please rate **each and every idea** on its **creativity**, using a scale from 1 (Very Low Creativity) to 10 (Exceptional Creativity). 
- We define creativity as a combination of novelty (how original or unexpected the idea is in this context) and usefulness (its potential practical value or impact in addressing the goal). Consider both aspects when assigning your score
**Critically evaluate and differentiate** between the ideas. Assign unique scores wherever possible. Only assign the same score if two ideas are genuinely indistinguishable in their level of creativity based on the definition above.
Ensure your final scores span a wide range across the 1-10 scale (e.g., the difference between the highest and lowest score should be at least 5 points, if the ideas' quality allows for such differentiation). Do not cluster scores narrowly.
Provide **ONLY** your scores. **Strictly adhere** to the format 'Idea X: Y', with each score on a new line. Do **not** include any explanations, justifications, summaries, or any other text before or after the list of scores.

2. Develop a comprehensive education and training program for employees focusing on sustainable practices, emphasizing daily behaviors such as energy conservation, waste reduction, and responsible consumption. Forge partnerships with environmental advocacy organizations to facilitate workshops that inspire behavioral change, integrate sustainability into corporate culture, and encourage grassroots initiatives. Empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools to enact change can foster a community-driven approach to combating global warming.
3. Encourage corporate-led afforestation projects that involve planting native trees in deforested or degraded areas around manufacturing facilities. Companies receive tax incentives and recognition for participating, while local communities gain employment opportunities. This enhances carbon sequestration and contributes to biodiversity conservation, acting as carbon sinks to offset emissions. The project can be integrated into corporate social responsibility initiatives, encouraging collaboration between industries and environmental organizations in a bid to restore ecosystems and foster sustainable development.
4. Develop an art mentorship program where seasoned artists guide younger generations in creating works that channel sustainable themes.
