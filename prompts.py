# *   **1-2: Low Priority:** My contribution adds very little *compared to the current idea*, seems off-topic, or is repetitive right now. I have almost no urge to interrupt.
# *   **3-4: Moderate-Low Priority:** My contribution offers a minor tweak or perspective. The current idea is okay, and my input can definitely wait without much loss.
# *   **5-6: Medium Priority:** My contribution adds noticeable value or a distinct angle *from my viewpoint/role*. It would improve the idea. Worth sharing reasonably soon.
# *   **7-8: High Priority:** I *strongly believe* my contribution offers a *significant improvement*, better aligns with *my expertise*, or addresses a weakness in the current idea. Sharing it now feels important for progress.
# *   **9-10: Critical Priority:** I am *convinced* my contribution *fundamentally redirects* the idea towards a much more creative/useful path, adds a *crucial insight* others might miss, or represents a potential *breakthrough*. It feels essential to share immediately.

# **Instructions:**
# - Score based on **your conviction** about your contribution's **immediate relevance and potential impact** *relative* to the current idea.
# - How important is **your unique role/expertise** at this *exact* moment?
# - Use the **full 1-10 scale (whole numbers only)** to reflect your genuine desire and perceived value. Don't default to the middle; be decisive based on your judgment.

# Respond first with the numerical score (e.g., '1'), followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning on a separate line, starting with "Reason: ".
