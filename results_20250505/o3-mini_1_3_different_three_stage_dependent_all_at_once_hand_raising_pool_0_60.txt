# **Discussion History**
The initial ideas under discussion before team feedback:
1. An integrated geoengineering solution, powered by AI-controlled drone fleets, could temporarily mitigate extreme heat and reduction of solar radiation in urban hotspots. These drones would deploy environmentally safe reflective aerosols or seeds to stimulate local reforestation. Real-time satellite imagery and ground sensor data would feed into adaptive algorithms to target areas most in need of cooling or vegetation growth. The dynamic nature of the system would allow for rapid adjustments in response to weather patterns, offering a scalable, reversible intervention that complements traditional mitigation strategies. This tech-nature hybrid approach could serve as a supplementary tool in the global effort to manage rising temperatures.
