The app fosters innovation and community support, transforming day-to-day environmental actions into a rewarding game-like experience.
Idea 12: Launch an international campaign that leverages sports events to promote environmental stewardship. This involves integrating eco-friendly practices within logistics of major tournaments like the Olympics or World Cupâ€”solar-powered stadiums, zero-waste goals, and sustainable merchandising. Collaborate with athletes, brands, and broadcasters to highlight environmental efforts, encouraging fans worldwide to adopt greener habits. This broad visibility can spur widespread cultural shifts by associating athletic enthusiasm with eco-consciousness.
Idea 13: Design a global mentorship platform that connects young innovators with elder environmentalists. The idea is to harness the wisdom of those who have been committed to environmental preservation before sustainability became mainstream, while fostering fresh, tech-savvy solutions from the youth. Combining traditional ecological knowledge with modern technology could lead to multifaceted approaches to solving global warming. This cross-generational partnership nurtures respect and enhances collaborative capabilities to implement impactful climate strategies.
Idea 14: Create a global network of "Climate Co-ops" where individuals pool resources for producing clean energy. Members could collectively invest in solar panels or wind turbines and receive energy dividends based on consumption and contribution. Co-ops can engage citizens directly in renewable production, making sustainable energy economically beneficial for the community and minimizing reliance on fossil fuels. Such a cooperative model empowers communities to own their eco-impact while reinforcing sustainable practices.
Idea 15: Develop an art and education program that combines art projects with climate awareness. By engaging students globally in creating art from recycled materials or depicting the effects and solutions of global warming, we instill awareness and proactive attitudes from a young age. The artworks can be displayed in public spaces or online, advocating dialogue and collective action.

# **Role**
You are Agent 3. You are a 26-year-old Asian female with a graduate degree in public health. You work as a product manager in a healthcare company. According to the Big Five model, below is your personality profile: Openness to Experience 3.2, Conscientiousness 4.0, Extraversion 2.5, Agreeableness 4.5, and Neuroticism 3.2. These personality scales range from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates a low score and 5 indicates a high score. You have the knowledge of this person. You talk like this person. You think like this person.

# **Task Requirement**
Task: Global warming, which refers to the ongoing increase in global average temperature, has an increasingly large impact on the environment. You are collaborating with two other team members to come up with one creative idea to slow global warming.
Your answers will be evaluated on its creativity (i.e., it should be both novel and useful).

# **Current Task**
- Below is the list of proposed ideas.
- Please rate **each and every idea** on its **creativity**, using a scale from 1 (Very Low Creativity) to 10 (Exceptional Creativity). 
- We define creativity as a combination of novelty (how original or unexpected the idea is in this context) and usefulness (its potential practical value or impact in addressing the goal). Consider both aspects when assigning your score
**Critically evaluate and differentiate** between the ideas. Assign unique scores wherever possible. Only assign the same score if two ideas are genuinely indistinguishable in their level of creativity based on the definition above.
Ensure your final scores span a wide range across the 1-10 scale (e.g., the difference between the highest and lowest score should be at least 5 points, if the ideas' quality allows for such differentiation). Do not cluster scores narrowly.
Provide **ONLY** your scores. **Strictly adhere** to the format 'Idea X: Y', with each score on a new line. Do **not** include any explanations, justifications, summaries, or any other text before or after the list of scores.

This emotional connection can stimulate personal and policy-level changes toward sustainable actions.
2. Introduce a community-led ocean cleanup initiative focused on innovative marine technology. Equip local fishing communities with drones and aquatic robots designed to collect plastic waste and monitor ecosystem health. Partner with tech firms to enhance these tools and incentivize the removal of plastics by offering biodegradable alternatives to fishing gear. This idea not only targets ocean pollution but also deeply involves stakeholders who rely directly on marine resources, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility toward ocean health.
3. We could promote urban vertical gardens by integrating plant walls and rooftop gardens into city infrastructures. This would not only absorb CO2 and produce oxygen but also cool urban heat islands, improve air quality, and create spaces for local biodiversity. Collaborations between artists and architects can transform these green spaces into visually stunning cityscapes that inspire community involvement and foster a greater connection with nature.
4. Create a mobile app-centered global challenge that encourages users to partake in "Sustainable Hackathons." Align individual skills with environmental objectives, allowing users to develop and share low-cost, high-impact solutions, from water-saving technologies to localized pollution trackers. Users could earn points and rewards based on the scalability or implementation success of their project's sustainable impact.

**Current Ideas Under Discussion:**
1. Create a mobile app-centered platform for a global "Green Innovators Challenge." This initiative invites individuals to tackle environmental issues by gamifying innovative solutions. Users can partake in challenges that solve sustainability problems, like rethinking urban spaces or designing carbon-neutral technologies. The app integrates social networking features to foster collaboration and cross-cultural exchange. Incentives include eco-friendly rewards and opportunities for venture capital funding. By merging technology with social motivation, this idea channels creativity and competition into practical climate solutions that are both scalable and impactful.

**Replacement Ideas Pool:**
1. We could promote urban vertical gardens by integrating plant walls and rooftop gardens into city infrastructures. This would not only absorb CO2 and produce oxygen but also cool urban heat islands, improve air quality, and create spaces for local biodiversity. Collaborations between artists and architects can transform these green spaces into visually stunning cityscapes that inspire community involvement and foster a greater connection with nature.
2. Establish a global initiative to incentivize the development and use of biodegradable human-made materials. Encourage governments and businesses to invest in research and development, providing grants or tax breaks to companies that successfully reduce or replace their non-biodegradable products. This would lessen long-term waste and environmental degradation, reducing the carbon footprint involved in the production and disposal of traditional materials.
3. Launch an international campaign that leverages sports events to promote environmental stewardship. This involves integrating eco-friendly practices within logistics of major tournaments like the Olympics or World Cupâ€”solar-powered stadiums, zero-waste goals, and sustainable merchandising. Collaborate with athletes, brands, and broadcasters to highlight environmental efforts, encouraging fans worldwide to adopt greener habits. This broad visibility can spur widespread cultural shifts by associating athletic enthusiasm with eco-consciousness.
4. Establishing a "Seed Swap" initiative aimed at preserving biodiversity while enhancing urban greening. Citizens participate in exchanging seeds of native plants, fostering community gardens and rooftop diversity. Partner with ecological experts to conduct workshops on planting techniques and climate resilience, promoting biodiversity as a tool against climate change. This initiative not only enriches urban landscapes but also heightens awareness of plant diversity in combating global warming, emphasizing grassroots participation.
5. Create a "Community Carbon Exchange" program where households and local businesses can buy and sell carbon credits within their communities. Such initiatives can motivate the reduction of individual carbon footprints while supporting innovation in energy efficiency and sustainable practices. Community-driven exchanges can also encourage networking, share successful practices, and build collective purpose in battling global warming.

**Previously Replaced Ideas:**
1. Construct floating eco-habitats that utilize aquaponic systems capable of producing food and biofuels. These self-sustaining communities could exist on large bodies of water, reducing land dependency and providing alternative living spaces amidst rising sea levels. With minimal environmental impact, floating habitats can become examples of closed-loop systems, simultaneously healing aquatic ecosystems and offering novel solutions to climate-induced relocations. Promoting investment in technology and infrastructure could make this futuristic living a sustainable reality.
2. Develop an international program that incentivizes artists and educators to collaborate in creating eco-art installations that double as air purification systems in urban areas.

By leveraging public spaces such as parks and building facades, these artworks provide aesthetic and environmental benefits, raising awareness and promoting community engagement. This initiative combines creativity and ecology, fostering a personal connection to environmental sustainability while contributing to cleaner urban atmospheres.
3. Develop a global "Eco-Leadership" league for youth that emphasizes solving environmental challenges creatively. Teenagers would form teams to tackle climate-related issues through STEM projects, art installations, or social campaigns. The league could culminate in a yearly competition showcasing solutions to a global audience, with scholarships, mentorship opportunities, and resources as rewards. Empowering the next generation to engage actively with climate solutions not only raises awareness but cultivates lifelong commitment to sustainable practices.
4. Organize global virtual reality art exhibits that immerse viewers in future scenarios of our planet based on current environmental trends. By using storytelling through visual arts, these immersive experiences can emotionally engage people by providing both dystopian and utopian outcomes based on actions taken today. This emotional connection can stimulate personal and policy-level changes toward sustainable actions.
5. Initiate a "Green Harmony" program where musicians and environmental scientists collaborate to create compositions inspired by nature and climate data. By translating data into music, audiences can experience the impact of global warming on an emotional level. Concerts and online platforms could feature these audio interpretations, making climate science accessible and engaging to a wider audience. This fusion of art and data fosters a deeper connection to environmental issues, spurring more personal and collective action toward sustainable practices.
6. Create a global network of "Climate Co-ops" where individuals pool resources for producing clean energy. Members could collectively invest in solar panels or wind turbines and receive energy dividends based on consumption and contribution. Co-ops can engage citizens directly in renewable production, making sustainable energy economically beneficial for the community and minimizing reliance on fossil fuels. Such a cooperative model empowers communities to own their eco-impact while reinforcing sustainable practices.
7. Introduce a community-led ocean cleanup initiative focused on innovative marine technology. Equip local fishing communities with drones and aquatic robots designed to collect plastic waste and monitor ecosystem health. Partner with tech firms to enhance these tools and incentivize the removal of plastics by offering biodegradable alternatives to fishing gear. This idea not only targets ocean pollution but also deeply involves stakeholders who rely directly on marine resources, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility toward ocean health.
8. Develop a global mentorship platform that specifically focuses on integrating young innovators and elder environmentalists to create new, eco-friendly financial models like "Eco Crowdfunding." This platform will enable the development and investment in sustainable projects ranging from green startups to community-focused conservation efforts. By harnessing the business acumen and wisdom of elders alongside the tech-savvy skills and ideas from the youth, this initiative can create sustainable financial incentives, motivate high-impact, community-driven projects, and foster economic growth aligned with environmental goals.
